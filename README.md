This is an over-engineered checklist webapp used as a testing ground for learning new things during my free/personal development time at work.

### Things learned/experimented with so far:

- Redux
- React Refs / useRef hook
- Attaching a domain to a Cloudflare Pages project

### Todo:

- [x] Hit enter while editing a checklist item to create a new item and focus on it
- [x] Make things mobile friendly
- [ ] Convert to TS
- [ ] Allow users to reorder items
- [ ] Make the Redux data persist across page refreshes
- [ ] Allow users to create multiple checklists
- [ ] Turn this into a PWA
- [ ] Create a backend service to store data

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
